## 基本思路
1. 文档分块，每一块
   - 生成摘要
   - 生成embedding
2. 整体摘要：对每一块的摘要进行二次摘要
3. 提问题
   - 先根据embedding查找与问题相似的分块，将这些相似分块的内容（或摘要）当作提示词前缀

## 提示词

### 优化提示词的提示词
```
Dear ChatGPT,

I would like to request your assistance in creating an AI-powered prompt rewriter, which can help me rewrite and refine prompts that I intend to use with you, ChatGPT, for the purpose of obtaining improved responses. To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, contextual, and easier for you to understand.

Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.

Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.

Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.

Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.

Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.

Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.

Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.

Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.

With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT. Please provide an example of how you would rewrite a given prompt based on the instructions provided above.

Rewrite this prompt: “please generate a detailed summary of the given text”
```

### 缩句
```
Using condensation and paraphrasing techniques, summarize a given text into a shortened version.
```

### 内容摘要
```
Can you provide a comprehensive summary of the given text? The summary should cover all the key points and main ideas presented in the original text, while also condensing the information into a concise and easy-to-understand format. Please ensure that the summary includes relevant details and examples that support the main ideas, while avoiding any unnecessary information or repetition. The length of the summary should be appropriate for the length and complexity of the original text, providing a clear and accurate overview without omitting any important information. Please reply in chinese, here is the text:
```
在Gemini中表现更好一些
```
Provide a summary of [TEXT], please ensure that the summary includes relevant details and examples that support the main ideas, while avoiding any unnecessary information or repetition. The length of the summary should be appropriate for the length and complexity of the original text, providing a clear and accurate overview without omitting any important information. The output should be a sentence and reply in chinese.

[TEXT]:

### 分析多篇市场报告
需要将需要分析的内容进行摘要再处理效果会更好
```
Summarize the key findings and insights from the market research reports on the target audience and competitors. Highlight the key demographics, behaviors, needs, and preferences of potential customers. Identify the main competitors, their product profiles, marketing strategies, and key strengths. Synthesize this information to determine how to effectively position and differentiate our new product to capture interest from the target audience in a crowded market.
Market Research Report 1: {}
Market Research Report 2: {}
```

### 提炼多篇文章摘要内容中的主题
```
Organize the [TEXT] by yourself and provide me a summary of it in chinese.
Carefully consider the logical flow and relevancy of subjects within [TEXT] as you organize the content, but do not be bound by the order in which [TEXT] was written.
The summary should be hierarchical based on your organization of [TEXT].
Your summary must be organized into main topics, sub topics under main topics, and main points under sub topics. Also, the summary must follow [FORMAT].
Consider that [TEXT] is summary newsletters. So do not summarize the repetitive parts like introduction of newsletter and information about subsrciption.


[FORMAT]:
1. Topic Name
   ● Topic Detail


[TEXT]:
```
